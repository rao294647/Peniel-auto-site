ACTION REQUIRED: Fix Billing Account Status

The deployment to Firebase Hosting (and Google Cloud) failed because the Billing Account linked to project 'peniel-auto-7392' is in a 'Delinquent' state (e.g. payment failed or card expired).

This prevents:
1. Creating Storage Buckets (required for uploading your code).
2. Using Cloud Build (required for containerizing your app).
3. Using Cloud Functions (required for Next.js Server Side Rendering).

EXECUTE THESE STEPS:
1. Go to the Google Cloud Console Billing section:
   https://console.cloud.google.com/billing

2. Select the billing account "01476F-DCFAA4-0428DF" (or the one linked to 'peniel-auto-7392').

3. Resolving the payment issue (Update payment method or pay outstanding balance).
   The status must be "Active", not "Delinquent" or "Closed".

4. Once fixed, run the deployment command again from your project root:
   firebase deploy --project peniel-auto-7392

Note: You do NOT need to run any other setup commands; the project is configured correctly, but purely blocked by payment status.
